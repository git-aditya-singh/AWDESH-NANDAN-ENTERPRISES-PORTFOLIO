# Awdesh Nandan Enterprises — Static Website
This is a ready-to-deploy static website codebase for **Awdesh Nandan Enterprises**, suitable for LCNG, pipeline and EPC contracting company profiles.

## What's included
- `index.html`, `about.html`, `services.html`, `projects.html`, `contact.html`
- `css/style.css` — minimal brand styling
- `js/main.js` — contact form behaviour (mailto)
- Uses Bootstrap 5 via CDN for responsive layout

## How to use
1. Unzip the package.
2. Edit the files (contact details, projects, company text).
3. Replace placeholder content and add photos in an `assets/` folder if needed.
4. Host on any static host: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or a traditional web host.

## Deployment suggestions
- **Netlify / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages** — drag & drop the site folder or connect a Git repo.
- **GitHub Pages** — push to a repo and enable Pages from the `main` branch (or `gh-pages`).

If you'd like, I can:
- Add a downloadable company profile PDF
- Convert contact form to send via Formspree / Netlify Forms
- Add Google Analytics / SEO meta tags tailored for your keywords
- Create CMS-enabled version (Webflow / Netlify CMS / Headless CMS)
